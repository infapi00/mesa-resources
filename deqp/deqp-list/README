This directories includes small scripts to analyze direcly qpa
files. Note that vk-gl-cts provides their own scripts but they can be
slow:

Also note that using that scripts would be needed to parse really big
qpa files (like those coming from a conformance run), as sed would not
handle files bigger that 2GB.
