This directory includes some scripts to be used with deqp/cts:

   * run-vulkan-cts-as-conformance.sh: does a full Vulkan CTS run, with the
     options required by conformance.

   * run-n-times-flaky-deqp-case.sh: run a deqp test n times, and
     returns how many runs have passed. Useful for flaky tests.

   * deqp-list: it includes small script to analyze direcly qpa
     files. vk-gl-cts provides their own scripts but they can be slow:

     * https://github.com/KhronosGroup/VK-GL-CTS/blob/master/external/openglcts/README.md#test-logs
